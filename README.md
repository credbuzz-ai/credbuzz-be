# CredBuzz Marketplace

A decentralized marketplace for influencer marketing campaigns built on Ethereum. The platform enables creators to create targeted campaigns for specific Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) or open campaigns for public participation.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The CredBuzz Marketplace consists of two main campaign types:

### 1. **Targeted Campaigns**

- Direct collaboration between creators and specific KOLs
- Pre-selected influencers for campaign execution
- Automated payment distribution with platform fees

### 2. **Public Campaigns (Open Campaigns)**

- Open pool campaigns for any eligible KOL
- Manual distribution by platform owner
- Flexible participation model

## üìã Campaign Status Flow

Both campaign types follow the same unified status system:

```
PUBLISHED ‚Üí FULFILLED/DISCARDED
```

- **PUBLISHED**: Campaign is active and available for fulfillment
- **FULFILLED**: Campaign has been successfully completed
- **DISCARDED**: Campaign has been cancelled and funds returned

## üîÑ Campaign Lifecycle

### Targeted Campaign Flow

1. **Campaign Creation**

   - Creator specifies KOL, amount, deadline, and token
   - Tokens are transferred to contract via `transferFrom`
   - Campaign status: `PUBLISHED`

2. **Campaign Fulfillment**

   - Selected KOL fulfills the campaign
   - Platform fees are deducted (10% by default)
   - Remaining amount is paid to KOL
   - Campaign status: `FULFILLED`

3. **Campaign Management**
   - Creator can update campaign details
   - Creator can discard campaign (funds returned)
   - Owner can pause/unpause contract

### Public Campaign Flow

1. **Campaign Creation**

   - Creator specifies pool amount, deadline, and token
   - Tokens are transferred to contract
   - Campaign status: `PUBLISHED`

2. **Campaign Completion**
   - Creator marks campaign as fulfilled or discarded
   - Funds are transferred to owner for manual distribution
   - Campaign status: `FULFILLED` or `DISCARDED`

## üìù Usage Examples

### Creating a Targeted Campaign

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function createTargetedCampaign() {
  const marketplace = await ethers.getContract("Marketplace");
  const token = await ethers.getContract("MockERC20");

  // Approve tokens first
  const amount = ethers.parseEther("1000");
  await token.approve(marketplace.address, amount);

  // Create campaign
  const selectedKol = "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890";
  const offeringAmount = ethers.parseEther("1000");
  const offerEndsIn = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 86400; // 24 hours
  const tokenAddress = token.address;

  const tx = await marketplace.createTargetedCampaign(
    selectedKol,
    offeringAmount,
    offerEndsIn,
    tokenAddress
  );

  await tx.wait();
  console.log("Targeted campaign created!");
}
```

### Creating a Public Campaign

```javascript
async function createPublicCampaign() {
  const marketplace = await ethers.getContract("Marketplace");
  const token = await ethers.getContract("MockERC20");

  // Approve tokens
  const poolAmount = ethers.parseEther("5000");
  await token.approve(marketplace.address, poolAmount);

  // Create open campaign
  const offerEndsIn = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 604800; // 7 days
  const tokenAddress = token.address;

  const tx = await marketplace.createPublicCampaign(
    offerEndsIn,
    poolAmount,
    tokenAddress
  );

  await tx.wait();
  console.log("Public campaign created!");
}
```

### Fulfilling a Targeted Campaign

```javascript
async function fulfillTargetedCampaign(campaignId) {
  const marketplace = await ethers.getContract("Marketplace");

  // Only selected KOL or owner can fulfill
  const tx = await marketplace.fulfilTargetedCampaign(campaignId);
  await tx.wait();

  console.log("Targeted campaign fulfilled!");
}
```

### Completing a Public Campaign

```javascript
async function completePublicCampaign(campaignId, isFulfilled) {
  const marketplace = await ethers.getContract("Marketplace");

  // Creator or owner can complete
  const tx = await marketplace.completePublicCampaign(campaignId, isFulfilled);
  await tx.wait();

  console.log("Public campaign completed!");
}
```

### Discarding a Public Campaign

```javascript
async function discardPublicCampaign(campaignId) {
  const marketplace = await ethers.getContract("Marketplace");

  // Creator or owner can discard
  const tx = await marketplace.discardPublicCampaign(campaignId);
  await tx.wait();

  console.log("Public campaign discarded!");
}
```

### Updating Campaign Details

```javascript
async function updateTargetedCampaign(campaignId) {
  const marketplace = await ethers.getContract("Marketplace");
  const token = await ethers.getContract("MockERC20");

  const newKol = "0x0987654321098765432109876543210987654321";
  const newAmount = ethers.parseEther("1200");
  const newDeadline = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 172800; // 48 hours

  // If increasing amount, approve additional tokens
  if (newAmount > oldAmount) {
    const additional = newAmount - oldAmount;
    await token.approve(marketplace.address, additional);
  }

  const tx = await marketplace.updateTargetedCampaign(
    campaignId,
    newKol,
    newDeadline,
    newAmount
  );

  await tx.wait();
  console.log("Targeted campaign updated!");
}
```

### Discarding a Campaign

```javascript
async function discardTargetedCampaign(campaignId) {
  const marketplace = await ethers.getContract("Marketplace");

  // Creator or owner can discard
  const tx = await marketplace.discardTargetedCampaign(campaignId);
  await tx.wait();
